# Wordle (Game)

![Theme-Black](https://github.com/Lakshan-Madushanka/wordle/assets/47297673/8e652491-5348-430e-a7a0-35c8f4ce0748)

## Intro
This project is a web-based version of the [Wordle game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle).

## Technologies
- Laravel framework
- Alpine.js
- Livewire

## Motivation
I stumbled upon a video where a creator began the project on his YouTube channel but left it incomplete.
Determined to see it through, I decided to start from scratch and bring it to completion.
What intrigued me most was the unconventional nature of this project.
Typically, our projects revolve around a business perspective, but this one encouraged me to venture into something refreshingly different.

## Requirements
- PHP >= 8.1
- composer
- Internet Connection (to connect with the external API to generate the word)

## Installation
- Clone the repository.
- copy .env.example to .env
- Open a terminal and run following commands
  - `composer install`
  - `npm run build or npm run dev`

## Features
- Dark Mode
- Help section (contains game instructions)
- Analysis

## How to play
This game follows the traditional Wordle rules, so there are no new instructions to explain. If you need guidance, a help section is available,
or you can simply search online if you're new to the game. The primary objective is to identify a five-letter word. Additionally, for dark mode enthusiasts,
you can easily enable it with a simple switch.
